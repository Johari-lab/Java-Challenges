# Java-Challenges

# Challenge 1: Find Maximum
Write a method maximum that returns the largest integer in the list. You can assume that the list has at least one element.

# Challenge 2: Print number in word
Write a program called printNumberInWord which prints "ONE", "TWO",... , "NINE", "OTHER" if the int variable "number" is 1, 2,... , 9, or other, respectively. Use:

(a) a "nested-if" statement;

(b) a "switch-case-default" statement.

# Challenge 3: Check Odd/Even
Write a method called checkOddEven which prints "Odd Number" if the int variable “number” is odd, or “Even Number” otherwise.

Hint n is an even number if (n % 2) is 0; otherwise, it is an odd number. Use == for comparison, e.g., (n % 2) == 0.

# Challenge 4: Calculate the average
Write a method average that returns the average of the integer in the list. You can assume that the list has at least one element.
